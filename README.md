# FacilPay Smart Contracts

Stellar-based smart contracts for FacilPay. Secure, auditable, and transparent payment infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Architecture

FacilPay uses Soroban smart contracts on Stellar for:
- **Payment Processing**: Accept and lock crypto payments
- **Settlement**: Convert and transfer to merchants in USDC
- **Escrow**: Hold funds during dispute periods
- **Refunds**: Process customer refunds

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Rust 1.74.0 or later
- Stellar CLI (`stellar` command)
- Soroban SDK

### Installation

# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install Stellar CLI
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt

# Add wasm target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Build All Contracts

# From root directory
make
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Test all contracts in workspace
cargo test --workspace

# Test specific contract
cargo test -p escrow
cargo test -p payment
cargo test -p refund

## 📂 Contract Overview

### Payment Contract (`contracts/payment`)

Handles payment creation and processing:
- `create_payment()` - Customer initiates payment
- `complete_payment()` - Admin releases to merchant
- `refund_payment()` - Admin refunds to customer
- `get_payment()` - Query payment details

### Escrow Contract (`contracts/escrow`)

Manages fund holding and disputes:
- `create_escrow()` - Lock funds
- `release_escrow()` - Release to merchant
- `dispute_escrow()` - Handle disputes

### Refund Contract (`contracts/refund`)

Processes refund requests:
- `request_refund()` - Merchant initiates
- `approve_refund()` - Admin approves
- `process_refund()` - Execute refund
